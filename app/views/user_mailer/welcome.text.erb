Hi,

I'm thrilled to welcome you to the Fivemarks community. I hope you'll find the best places for your upcoming travels and will share your best tips about the cities you've been to.

The community is all about the best places in the world whether they're beautiful, cheap, weird, fun, hazardous or whatever... 

When adding a place, just ask yourself: Does it really belong to my black book?

See ya!
